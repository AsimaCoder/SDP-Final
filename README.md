## Project Overview üéÆ
</br>
The Mortal Combat Game System is a Java-based project aimed at delivering an immersive gaming experience with a focus on the renowned Mortal Kombat theme. This initiative revolves around creating a dynamic gaming platform where users can select and control their chosen hero, each endowed with unique abilities, within a virtual combat environment. </br>
</br>
The core idea is to establish a robust gaming framework that enables users to engage in dynamic battles by choosing characters from the Mortal Kombat universe. This not only allows players to explore the distinctive abilities of each hero but also adds strategic depth and excitement to the overall gaming experience.</br>
</br>
The primary purpose of this project is to enhance the usability and clarity of the gaming system. By developing an intuitive interface and implementing efficient controls, the Mortal Combat Game System aims to streamline the user experience, making it accessible and enjoyable for both novice and experienced gamers.</br>
</br>
Key objectives include implementing a user-friendly interface for character selection and abilities, creating an interactive gaming environment with smooth and responsive controls, enhancing usability through simplified mechanics and tutorials, introducing elements for strategic depth in gameplay, and incorporating user feedback for continuous improvement.</br>

## Main Body

Adapter:

![Adapter](https://github.com/AsimaCoder/SDP-Final/assets/129418969/43c33ff4-52ab-4228-aab2-3a6e9e745b5d)

Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
 In our project it plays the role that connects two different characters and enables one character's abilities to another.
 
public class PowerAdapterImpl implements PowerAdapter {
    private final Character character;


    // Takes any character
    public PowerAdapterImpl(Character character) {
        this.character = character;
    }


    // Uses their power
    @Override
    public void usePower() {
        System.out.println("---------------------------------------------------------");
        character.performAttack();
    }
}

Decorator:
![Decorator](https://github.com/AsimaCoder/SDP-Final/assets/129418969/000ff32a-4361-45b7-8446-ce686a9f96e0)

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors. In our project it provides additional ability to the character.

public class FireAttackDecorator implements AttackDecorator {
    private final AttackStrategy decoratedStrategy;

    public FireAttackDecorator(AttackStrategy decoratedStrategy) {
        this.decoratedStrategy = decoratedStrategy;
    }

    // Decorate any attack with fire ability
    @Override
    public void rangeOfAttack() {
        decoratedStrategy.rangeOfAttack();
        System.out.println("---------------------------------------------------------");
        System.out.println("Adds fire damage!");
    }
}

Factory:
![Factory](https://github.com/AsimaCoder/SDP-Final/assets/129418969/9e1d6308-b9b9-49a3-a869-1a430eb39dfc)

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In our project it allows user to choose the charater and enables them to create that character.

public class CharacterFactory {
    public static Character createCharacter(String characterType) {
        switch (characterType.toLowerCase()) {
            case "scorpion":
                System.out.println("Created character: Scorpion.");
                System.out.println("---------------------------------------------------------");
                return new Scorpion();
            case "subzero":
                System.out.println("Created character: SubZero.");
                System.out.println("---------------------------------------------------------");
                return new SubZero();
            case "smoke":
                System.out.println("Created character: Smoke.");
                System.out.println("---------------------------------------------------------");
                return new Smoke();
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid character type. Supported types: scorpion, subzero, smoke");
        }
    }
}


Observer:
![Observer](https://github.com/AsimaCoder/SDP-Final/assets/129418969/41775af2-59da-49a5-96d5-813efcb4af08)

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they‚Äôre observing. In our code it allows the observes to be notified who entered the game and what is their name.

public class GameNotifier implements Subject {

    private final List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    // Add observer

    @Override
    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    // Remove observer

    @Override
    public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    // Notify Observers

    @Override
    public void notifyObservers(String message) {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(message);
        }
    }
}


Singleton:
![Singleton](https://github.com/AsimaCoder/SDP-Final/assets/129418969/3f968c8e-1a31-4f32-b3ba-a992979ba80f)

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance. In our project ot ensures that there is only one game manager.

public class GameManager {
    private static GameManager instance;
    private String userName;

    private GameManager() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    // Single instance implementation
    public static GameManager getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new GameManager();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Get Username

    public String getUserName() {
        return userName;
    }

    // Set Username
    public void setUserName(String userName) {
        this.userName = userName;
    }

}

Strategy:
![Strategy](https://github.com/AsimaCoder/SDP-Final/assets/129418969/01eb8d95-b801-4dbb-9fc4-aa23c2785c4a)

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable. in our project it allows user to change the abilities of the character.

public class AttackStrategyFactory {
    public static AttackStrategy createAttackStrategy(String attackType) {
        switch (attackType.toLowerCase()) {
            case "basic":
                return new BasicAttack();
            case "special":
                return new SpecialAttack();
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid attack type. Supported types: basic, special");
        }
    }
}
